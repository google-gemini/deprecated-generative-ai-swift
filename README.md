## Developers who use the PaLM SDK for Swift

​​If you're using the PaLM SDK for Swift, review the information below to continue using the PaLM SDK until you've migrated to the new version that allows you to use Gemini.

- To continue using PaLM models, make sure your app depends on version [`0.3.0`](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift/releases/tag/0.3.0) _up to_ the next minor version ([`0.4.0`](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift/releases/tag/0.4.0)) of `generative-ai-swift`.

- When you're ready to use Gemini models, migrate your code to the Gemini API and update your app's `generative-ai-swift` dependency to version `0.4.0` or higher.

To see the PaLM documentation and code, go to the [`palm` branch](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift/tree/palm).
