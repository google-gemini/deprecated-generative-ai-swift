# Google AI Swift SDK for PaLM (Decommissioned)

> [!CAUTION]
> This version (`0.3.0`) of the SDK was intended for use with the PaLM API,
> which is now [decommissioned](https://ai.google.dev/palm_docs/deprecation).
> This means that users cannot use a PaLM model in a prompt, tune a new PaLM
> model, or run inference on PaLM-tuned models.
>
> Note: This is different from the
> [Vertex AI PaLM API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/text),
> which is scheduled to be decommissioned in October 2024.

To interact with models using Google AI services and tooling, use the Gemini
API, which is now available in a stable version. For more information on
migrating from PaLM to Gemini, see the
[migration guide](https://ai.google.dev/docs/migration_guide) and the
[`main`](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-swift/tree/main) branch
of this repo to use the new version of the SDK.
